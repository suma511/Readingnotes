# object and classes
- Object: every elemnt in the world we idintify it as an object it has some specification that make them unique we use object in programming to model the real-world objects that you find in everyday life
each key has a behavior and state
as an example cats have some behavior like she can sleep and a charachtaristic like the color of the cat and all the objects can be classified in this way

Bundling code into individual software objects provides a number of benefits, including:

Modularity: The source code for an object can be written and maintained independently of the source code for other objects
Information hiding: By interacting only with an object's methods, the details of its internal implementation remain hidden from the outside world.
Code re-use: If an object already exists (perhaps written by another software developer), you can use that object in your program. 
Pluggability and debugging ease: If a particular object turns out to be problematic, you can simply remove it from your application and plug in a different object 

- classes
its describing and handle the objects from the same kinde or tybe we use it to structure our code 
- Inheritance : provides a powerful and natural mechanism for organizing and structuring the software. 

## Interface
An interface is a contract between a class and the outside world. When a class implements an interface, it promises to provide the behavior published by that interface.

## Package
its like a platform when we import it to our code it organize our code to make it sufficient and to orgnaize class and makes large software projects easier to manage.
Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

## Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers
we use types of systems to implement the characteres and numbers 
* Binary system : it's implemnting the numbers in 0-1 form as an example if we want to represent the base of it is 2
1 -> 001
2 -> 010
3 -> 011 
etc..
the base of the system is '2'
its commonly used in computer proccess

* Decimal : its impleminting the numbers from [0-9] the base of this system is 10

* Hexadecimal : its impleminting the numbers from [0-9/A-F] the base of it is 16
